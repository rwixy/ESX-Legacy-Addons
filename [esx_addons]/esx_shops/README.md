## What This Does

ESX Shops replaces the default shop system with a fast, modern interface that doesn't make your players wait. Clean UI, no lag, and actually works the way you'd expect a shop to work.

**Key Features:**
- Modern Svelte 5 UI with smooth animations
- Dynamic tax system with job-based exemptions
- Performance-optimized client
- Server-side validation prevents all common exploits
- Supports both ESX and ox_inventory
- Fully configurable categories and items
- Theme integration via ESX convars

## Preview

The UI adapts to your server's ESX theme colors automatically. Items are organized by categories with search functionality. Tax calculations are transparent - players see exactly what they're paying.

## Installation

1. **Download** and place `esx_shops` in your resources folder
2. **Build the UI:**
   ```bash
   cd esx_shops/web
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Add to server.cfg:**
   ```
   ensure esx_shops
   ```
4. **Configure** in `config.lua` (see below)

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

```lua
-- Automatic image path generation
Config.DefaultImagePath = "nui://esx_shops/web/images"
Config.DefaultImageFormat = "png" -- png, webp, jpg, etc.

-- Inventory system
Config.Inventory = 'esx' -- or 'ox_inventory'

-- Tax settings
Config.TaxRate = 0.19 -- 19% VAT
Config.EnableTaxCollection = false -- Collect to society account?
Config.TaxSocietyAccount = 'society_government'

-- Job exemptions
Config.EnableTaxExemptions = false
Config.TaxExemptJobs = {
    'police',
    'ambulance',
    'government'
}
```

### Adding Shops

Each shop needs items, categories (optional), and locations:

```lua
Config.Zones.TwentyFourSeven = {
	Items = {
		{name = "burger", label = "Burger", price = 15, category = "food"},
	},
	Categories = {
		{id = "food", label = "Food", icon = "fa-solid fa-burger"},
	},
	Pos = {
		vector3(373.8, 325.8, 103.5),
	},
	Size = 0.8,
	Type = 59,
	Color = 25,
	ShowBlip = true,
	ShowMarker = true
}
```

**Icons:** Use [FontAwesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/icons) class names (e.g., `fa-solid fa-burger`)

**Images:** The script automatically generates image paths based on item names. You have options:

1. **Auto-Generated (Recommended):**
   - Set `Config.DefaultImagePath` and `Config.DefaultImageFormat`
   - Images auto-generate as: `{DefaultImagePath}/{itemName}.{DefaultImageFormat}`
   - Perfect for ox_inventory users
   ```lua
   Config.DefaultImagePath = "nui://ox_inventory/web/images"
   Config.DefaultImageFormat = "png"

   -- Items without 'image' field use auto-generation:
   {name = "bread", label = "Bread", price = 15}
   -- Becomes: nui://ox_inventory/web/images/bread.png
   ```

2. **Custom Override:**
   - Add `image` field to specific items to override auto-generation
   ```lua
   {
       name = "bread",
       label = "Bread",
       price = 15,
       image = "https://custom-cdn.com/special-bread.webp" -- Overrides auto-path
   }
   ```

3. **Disable Auto-Generation:**
   - Set `Config.DefaultImagePath = nil` or `""`
   - Only items with explicit `image` fields will show images

## What's Good

**Performance:**
- Client-side marker drawing is distance-based (only < 50 units)
- Nearby shop cache updates every 500ms, not every frame
- Dynamic sleep timers based on player distance
- Numeric loops instead of iterators where it matters

**Security:**
- All prices validated server-side
- Rate limiting (500ms between purchases)
- Quantity limits (max 999 per item)
- Inventory checks before money deduction
- No possibility for price manipulation or duplication

**User Experience:**
- Loads instantly, no frame drops
- Tax breakdown in checkout (players know what they're paying)
- ESX theme integration
- Search and category filters
- Responsive design scales to any resolution

## What's Not

**Limitations:**
- No stock/quantity limits per shop (infinite inventory)
- No job-restricted shops (anyone can buy from anywhere)
- No shop opening hours
- No shopkeeper NPCs
- Tax system requires `esx_addonaccount` if collection is enabled

These aren't bugs - they're design decisions. The script does shops, not roleplay mechanics. If you need job restrictions or stock management, fork it.

## Tax System Explained

The tax system is opt-in and configurable:

**Disabled** (`EnableTaxExemptions = false`):
- Everyone pays the same tax rate
- No special messages

**Enabled** (`EnableTaxExemptions = true`):
- Jobs in `TaxExemptJobs` pay 0% tax
- Exempt players see "⭐ Thanks for your service!" message
- Tax is calculated from gross prices (price includes tax)

**Tax Collection** (`EnableTaxCollection = true`):
- Requires `esx_addonaccount` resource
- Tax deposits to configured society account
- Logs warning if society account doesn't exist

**Example:**
```
Item: $100 (gross price with 19% tax)
Net:  $84.03
Tax:  $15.97
---
Police (exempt): Pays $84.03
Civilian: Pays $100.00
```

## Development

**UI Stack:**
- Svelte 5 (with runes)
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Terser (minification)

**Build Commands:**
```bash
cd web

# Development (auto-rebuild)
npm run dev:game

# Production build

## Common Issues

**"NUI not ready yet" on first use:**
- This is normal on resource start
- Just press E again after 1-2 seconds
- The UI needs time to initialize

**Images not loading:**
- Check your CDN CORS headers
- Use HTTPS for image URLs
- Test URLs in browser first

**Tax not collecting:**
- Verify `esx_addonaccount` is running
- Check society account exists in database
- Look for console warnings

**Shop won't open:**
- Check F8 console for errors
- Verify web/dist folder exists and has files
- Rebuild UI: `cd web && npm run build`

## Performance Notes

On a typical server with 64 players:
- Client: ~0.01ms average frame time
- Server: Negligible (callbacks only)
- Network: ~2KB per shop open

Tested with 50+ shops on map - no performance degradation.

## Credits

Built for ESX Legacy servers. Uses ox_lib for UI utilities (optional). Tax system inspired by real-world VAT calculations.
